1. Check the project board and create a task/issue.
2. Do not push directly to the `main` branch or an `iter-xx` branch.
3. Use an existing feature branch of an iteration to develop, test, and push code. Or make your feature branch off an `iter-xx` branch. Be careful not to branch off the `main`. Example branch to work in `iter-01-backend`.
4. Make changes, write and pass unit tests for all changes.
5. Once you have finished work on your branch, create a pull request from your feature branch into the current iteration branch or another feature branch. Example: `iter-01-backend` into `iter-01`.
6. Please do not approve your pull request immediately. Instead, post in Slack to have your code reviewed.
7. Once at least one and ideally two people review it, address any feedback.
8. Continue this process until your code is approved!
9. Merge your branch!
10. Mark your issue as resolved and move it (in the project board) to the “done” column. Yay!
